Gamma + jet JERC analysis framework
==================
This module is the first step of the gamma + jet analysis : 

See instruction here:
https://github.com/lattaud/DijetRootTreeMaker/blob/master/instructions/GammaJetTree_Instruction.txt


This framework has 3 modules that have to be run in this order :

1- DijetRootTreeMaker which produce the Ntuples                                                            : https://github.com/lattaud/DijetRootTreeMaker.git 
2- DijetRootTreeAnalyzer which reduce the Ntuple by applying the selection and allow to run JEC on the fly : https://github.com/lattaud/DijetRootTreeAnalyzer.git
3- NewGammaJet which is the plotting step                                                                  : https://github.com/lattaud/NewGammaJet.git

Instruction can be found in each step repository.
